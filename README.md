Class Reunion Website | XII K Batch 2026
This project is a digital reunion website (digital yearbook) created specifically for Class XII K, Batch 2026. Focusing on aesthetic and interactive design, the website utilizes the Glassmorphism effect to create a modern, elegant look that highlights the content beneath.

✨ Key Features
Glassmorphism Design: Implements an elegant frosted-glass effect on main elements (sidebar, header, content area) to provide a unique visual experience.

Single-Page Experience (Fast Transitions): Utilizes quick and smooth fade-out and fade-in page transitions using JavaScript, providing an app-like navigation experience.

Photo Gallery Lightbox: Responsive gallery functionality with a modal overlay to display photo details with a premium feel.

Digital Guestbook: A guestbook feature that allows visitors (class members) to leave messages and impressions, which are saved locally using Local Storage.

Interactive Cards (Parallax): A subtle parallax effect on the main link cards on the homepage when hovered over, adding depth and interactivity.

Search Functionality: A responsive class member search feature, making navigation through long lists of names easier.

Clean Architecture: Well-organized code structure, separating main functionalities into different logic blocks in JavaScript.

🛠️ Technologies Used
HTML5: Core page structure.

CSS3: Styling, flexible layouts (Flexbox/Grid), and implementation of the Glassmorphism effect.

JavaScript (Vanilla JS): Manages all interactions, page transitions, guestbook logic, and search functions.
